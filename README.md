## Cafeco App

This is the WIP of the front end of team Leaf's web application - CafeCo

CafeCo aims to bring together and promote sustainable cafes and restaurants by enabling users to discover these eateries as well as encouraging them to return with a reward system.

### Version Notes
The key functionality addressed in this version (28/04/2019) is 'Users can discover sustainable eateries to visit'.
This is supported by:

1. A map that displays markers of all partnered businesses that when clicked on brings the user to the eatery's full profile page with further information on location, opening hours, sustainable practices etc.

2. A complete list of partnered eateries sorted alphabetically.

3. A search bar that searches by eatery name.

The front end of these three features have been implemented and will be fully functional once the back end is connected.

The front end of most other functionalities (e.g. ratings, reviews, login, signup, user profile, business dashboard) are underway if not completed. 


### Getting Started
This is a react app. Test run by "npm start" or "yarn start"



### NOTE: This repository contains only the frontend web app for the Web Info Tech Project.
